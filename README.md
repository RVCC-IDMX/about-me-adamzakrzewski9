# Description

This is the About Me project for Web Development. It will be used as a portfolio. This project uses HTML5 and CSS. Topics covered include color accessibility, responsive design, navigation bars, menus, transitions, transforms, tables, forms, elements, images, links, and general styling. A Github social media icon was added to the footer.

# Color Scheme

favicon and logo added.

Changed colors to match new logo and be more visually appealing. Checked that color changes improved contrast from AA to AAA.

Tested for color contrast and accessibility. Color contrast conformance levels were tested using Chrome Developer Tools and preference media queries, such as "prefers-color-scheme".

Here is a good video on using Google Chrome developer tools to improve contrast.

Here is the color contrast before making changes. It is AA compliant, but not AAA compliant:
